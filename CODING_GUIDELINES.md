# Gemini Code Assist Coding Guidelines

This document outlines the rules and conventions for Gemini Code Assist when working on this repository.

## Core Principles

- **Optimized for AI Collaboration:** The primary user of this codebase may not read the code directly. Therefore, all code should be written and structured in a way that is optimal for maintenance and future modifications by Gemini Code Assist. This includes clear naming, logical separation of concerns, and adherence to established patterns within the project.
- **Focused and Isolated Changes:** Great care must be taken to ensure that any changes are strictly limited to the scope of the user's request. Modifications should not have unintended side effects on other parts of the application. All changes must be precise and targeted.
